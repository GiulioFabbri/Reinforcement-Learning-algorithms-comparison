## Reinforcement-Learning-algorithms-comparison
In this project we will use the gymnasium environment for blackjack.   
We will first describe the game of **blackjack**, and then dwell on how the game is modeled with the **gymnasium environment**.    
Then we will implement models and confront them:    

- A **Random model** will be used as benchmark and for making performance measures and plots   

- **Q-learning (TD)** because is much used in the game   

- **SARSA (TD)** for making hypotesis about on-policy vs off-policy in this context   

- **Monte Carlo** for providing a defense of on-policy methods and try to replicate the Sutton e Barto Blackjack example
